// MakeEventsChan implements a channel of events with an unlimited capacity. It does so

// and no events get lost.
//
// The unlimited capacity channel is very suitable for delivering events because the consumer
// may be unavailable for some time (doing a heavy computation), but will get to the events
// later.
//
// An unlimited capacity channel has its dangers in general, but is completely fine for
// the purpose of delivering events. This is because the production of events is fairly
// infrequent and should never out-run their consumption in the long term.
